***Business Problem***

A Netflix associate wants to understand the frequency of shows being released on Netflix, what are the popular genres, how are the shows rated, etc. They also want to understand these aspects based on different dates it gets released on the Netflix Platform and compares stats based on Movies or TV Shows alone. 

-> After removing duplicates and blank rows the total number of rows are **7750**.

**Problem Statement**
1. Netflix associate wants to find out the number of shows released in each genre. Create a bar chart and find out how many Shows are listed as Documentaries.<br>
-> 334

2. The Associate wants to find out what is the overall count of Movies and TV Shows. Find out how is the data distributed and find the percentage of Movies in Netflix when compared to TV Shows. (Answer with % sign)<br>
-> 69.12%

3. The netflix associate wants to understand about show ratings on Netflix. He wants to find out how all shows are categorised based on the ratings.<br> Also he wants it to be filtered based on Movies, TV Shows or both.<br>
   Created a column chart to find how many Movie shows in total are rated as “TV-MA”? (TV-MA means Suitable only for Mature Audience)<br>
-> 1836

4. The Netflix associate wants to know the total count of shows released each month for each type( Movie and TV shows) separately.<br> Additionally he wants it to be able to filter based on range of dates.<br>
   Used a Stacked chart/ Clustered column chart for this task.<br>

   Q.1 What are the total number of TV shows released in the month of May? -> 171<br>
   Q.2 How many Movies are released in the month of June, between January 16th, 2011 to January 16th, 2021? -> 376

5. The netflix associate wants to compare total number of shows vs distinct number of genres released each month. Create a line chart to find out how many unique genres are released in the month of January.<br>
-> 207
